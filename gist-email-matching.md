## Regex Components

A regex is considered a literal, so the pattern must be wrapped in slash characters (/). If we look at "Matching an Email Address" regex, you will notice that this is true:

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

### Anchors

The starting anchor in this Regex is ^ this will always indicate the beginning of the string. The ending anchor for this Regex is $ this will always indicate the ending of the string.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are what tell the expression how many characters it needs to search for to make a match. Some of the common quantifiers in this expression are:

The + operator, which will connect the users email name + email service + .com.

{2,6}, this will allow a match range of 2-6 characters for the character set of [a-z\.].


### Grouping Constructs

() are used in this expression to capture groupings of code and make them work together. Some of these were mentioned in the quantifiers.

1st group ([a-z0-9_\.-]+)

2nd group ([\da-z\.-]+)

3rd group ([a-z\.]{2,6})

This grouping system allows us to easily see the code and break it into the parts for the email.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions for this Regex include the character sets of [a-z0-9_\.-], which is matching any letter a-z and is case sensitive. It also matches a character 0-9 and matches the characters "_", "-", and "." as seen in the 3 groups above.
